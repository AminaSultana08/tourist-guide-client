##About The Tourist Guide Website
- This Website name is Paladium Awatis. It's a Bangladeshi Tourist Guide website . There is a dashbord with 3 user role for Admin,Tourist Guide and User. Admin has profile page, manage users page and add packages page. Admin can manage users and tourist guide account and make users to tour guide. Admin can add tour packages as well and delete too.Admin can see tourist guide  and users dashboard but tourist guide and user can't see admin dashboard, I've used JWT for the security, Verify token so that one user can't access another user's information and tourist guide information. only Admin has the access permission.
- For tourist there is another dashboard, Tourist guide has his profile.
- At User dashbord. User can see the homepage and there is a overview of few tourist places at tab , User can see  at another tab name "Our Packages".if user can see few packages at "Our packages tab and there are "Show All Packages" button .By clicking the "Show All Packages" button , it will redirect user to "Our Packages" page, user can view details of the package and add to wish list, what is connected with user dashboard. So User can see all the packages the add at wishlist. Users can delete any package from their wishList.
