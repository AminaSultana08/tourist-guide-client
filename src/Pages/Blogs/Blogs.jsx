           <p className="text-lg ">
           If you're looking for the most popular tourist places in Bangladesh, you should definitely visit Cox's Bazar, located alongside the Bay of Bengal beach. It has the world's largest unbroken sea beach that stretches more than one hundred and twenty kilometers.

           You can also find here miles of golden sands, surfing waves, towering cliffs, rare conch shells, waterfalls, pagodas, and parks. Aggmeda Khyang, which is a huge Buddhist monastery, is the major attraction of Cox's Bazar, containing ancient manuscripts and large bronze Buddha pictures.
